## About this project

The main purpose of this project is to keep my abilities up-to-date. And, if posible, improve my abilities.

This project belongs to a series in which I will be creating the very same APIs in different languages (Java, Javascript, C#, Golang, C, C++ and Python). Inside this folder, anything Javascript related will be found. That includes Angular, Vue and React libraries and frameworks.

A mock server has been created for testing the different frontend/application part APIs.

### APIs until now

   - Javascript generic API for requesting and editing data from a REST server (ongoing)
   - Angular API (typescript) for requesting and editing data from a REST server. Also created an UI (not begun). Thought for implementing in any REST project.
   - Vue.js API for requesting and editing data from a REST server. Also created an UI (not begun). Thought for implementing in any REST project.
   - React.js API for requesting and editing data from a REST server. Also created an UI. (not begun). Thought for implementing in any REST project.
